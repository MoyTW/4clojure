4clojure
========
Solutions to every problem listed on 4Clojure.com as of 2014-3-9, as well as a scraper which automatically writes saved solutions from the website into a directory. 

ScratchPaper contains my scratch paper.

Solutions are in the Solutions folder, one problem per file. The numbers are not continuous, due to the 4Clojure numbering scheme.

Rewrites and commentary are in the UpdatedCommentedSolutions; not all problems have been addressed.

The script used to pull the solutions into the Solutions folder is located in scraper-4clojure.

I use notepad++, so I've also included the language file here.
